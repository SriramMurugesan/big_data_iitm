Linux is an example of an operating system. Which of the following is considered as the "operating system of a cluster of machines" and why?

Options :

Hive, because it executes SQL queries without users having to worry aboutmemory and disk, much like Linux

Spark, because it executes Python jobs without users having to worry aboutmemory and disk, much like Linux

Zookeeper, because it ensures the consistency of state for all machines in thecluster

YARN, because it manages available resources of the cluster

Answer : YARN, because it manages available resources of the cluster

YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator) is considered the "operating system of a cluster of machines" because it manages and allocates resources (CPU, memory, and other computational resources) across multiple nodes in a distributed system. It ensures that different applications running on the cluster get the required resources while optimizing utilization and preventing conflicts.

explanation:
Hive – Hive is a data warehousing tool that allows SQL-like querying on big data using Hadoop. However, it does not manage resources in a cluster. It relies on underlying systems like YARN for execution.

Spark – Apache Spark is a distributed computing framework that processes large-scale data. While it abstracts memory and disk management from users, it does not manage the overall resources of the cluster itself. Instead, it can run on YARN.

Zookeeper – Apache Zookeeper ensures coordination and consistency among distributed applications but does not manage cluster resources.

YARN – YARN is responsible for resource management and job scheduling in a Hadoop cluster. It dynamically allocates CPU, memory, and other resources to different applications running on the cluster, making it function as the "operating system" of a cluster.
