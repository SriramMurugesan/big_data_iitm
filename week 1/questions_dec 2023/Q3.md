Which of the following statements about Spark application architecture is correct?

Options :

A Spark program generates a set of `tasks` that are grouped into stages, each ofwhich executes concurrently with the driver being responsible for collecting results from eachstage for final output.

A Spark `action` generates a job, with each job being broken down into multiplestages where a stage is a set of tasks that can be executed in parallel and stages themselves areinterdependent, with each task being the unit of work mapped to an executor.

A Spark `program` generates a job, with each job being broken down intomultiple stages where a stage is a set of tasks that can be executed in parallel and stagesthemselves are interdependent, with each task being the unit of work mapped to an executor.

A Spark `action` generates a `task` that is further broken down into multiplestages where a stage is a set of jobs that can be executed in parallel and stages themselves areinterdependent, with each job being the unit of work mapped to an executor.

A Spark `program` generates a `task` that is further broken down into multiplestages where a stage is a set of jobs that can be executed in parallel and stages themselves areinterdependent, with each job being the unit of work mapped to an executor.

Answer:"A Spark action generates a job, with each job being broken down into multiple stages where a stage is a set of tasks that can be executed in parallel and stages themselves are interdependent, with each task being the unit of work mapped to an executor."

# job -> stages(interdependent) -> tasks(parallel) -> executor(unit of work)

The correct answer is:  

**"A Spark action generates a job, with each job being broken down into multiple stages where a stage is a set of tasks that can be executed in parallel and stages themselves are interdependent, with each task being the unit of work mapped to an executor."**  

This matches the correct Spark application architecture because:  
- **A Spark action (like `collect()`, `count()`, etc.) triggers a job**.  
- **A job is divided into multiple stages** based on transformations and shuffle boundaries.  
- **Each stage consists of multiple tasks** that can run in parallel on executors.  
- **Tasks are the smallest unit of execution**, and each task is scheduled on an executor.  

So, the correct option from your choices is:  
âœ… **"A Spark action generates a job, with each job being broken down into multiple stages where a stage is a set of tasks that can be executed in parallel and stages themselves are interdependent, with each task being the unit of work mapped to an executor."**
