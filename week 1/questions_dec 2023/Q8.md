Consider an application that can scale from handling 1000 users to handling 100 million users by simply making copies of itself, is able to seamlessly react to machines going offline by again making new copies of itself in new machines, and otherwise leaves behind no trace of its workings. Which of the following statements is true?

Options :

This application has adopted cloud-native design

This application cannot be called as cloud-native since it is not observable at alltimes

This application cannot be called as cloud-native since it is not manageableeasily

This application cannot be called as cloud-native since it is not resilient

Answer : This application has adopted cloud-native design

Explanation:
A cloud-native application is designed to scale dynamically, recover from failures automatically, and be stateless or ephemeral (leaving no trace). The described application exhibits:

Elastic Scalability → Can handle 1000 to 100 million users just by making copies of itself.
Self-healing & Resilience → Reacts to failures by creating new copies in different machines.
Statelessness & Ephemerality → Leaves no trace of its workings, which is a key trait of cloud-native microservices.
Why not the other options?
❌ "Not observable at all times" → Cloud-native apps use logging and monitoring tools, but observability is not a strict requirement for an app to be cloud-native.
❌ "Not manageable easily" → The application manages itself by replicating on demand, which actually makes it easier to manage.
❌ "Not resilient" → The app automatically recovers from failures, proving its resilience.
